# Ensemble Methods for Classification

This notebook provides an exhaustive exploration and comparison of various Decision Tree Ensemble models applied to a classification problem. It's structured to guide you through the necessary steps of data preprocessing, model training, parameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Notebook Overview

- **Environment Setup**: Initial setup involves importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, and xgboost. Ensure you have these libraries installed in your environment to run the notebook smoothly.

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame from a CSV file hosted on GitHub. This step includes cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

- **Model Exploration**: We explore several ensemble methods including Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGBoost. For each model, the process of finding the optimal number of estimators (n_estimators) is detailed, showcasing how to maximize model performance.

- **Performance Evaluation**: The notebook guides you through evaluating model performance, focusing on accuracy and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Comparisons across different models and their configurations provide insights into their effectiveness for the given dataset.

- **Results Analysis**: After training and evaluating each model, the notebook concludes with a summary of the best accuracy and AUC scores achieved by each method. This section helps in understanding which ensemble technique performed best for the specific classification problem at hand.

## Key Sections

1. **Finding Optimal Value for n_estimators - Random Forest Classifier**: This section demonstrates how to iteratively test different values for `n_estimators` to find the optimal number that yields the highest accuracy for the Random Forest Classifier.

2. **AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGBoost**: Here, we dive into three popular ensemble techniques, configuring and comparing them on the same dataset. Installation instructions for required packages are included.

3. **Best Accuracy and AUC for Each Model**: The notebook concludes by presenting a comparative analysis of the Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGBoost models, highlighting the best-performing model based on accuracy and AUC metrics.
